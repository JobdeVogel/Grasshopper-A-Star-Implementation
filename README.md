This Grasshopper script will calculate the shortest path in a 2D/3D grid or a grid based on a building, based on the A-Star Algorithm, found in 1968 by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute.

The purpose of this project was an implementation by only using basic python modules of the IronPython 2.6 node available in Grasshopper.
